# F-Droid privileged extension installer
A script that install the f-droid privileged extension manually. You might need this, if flashing the extension doesn't work for some reason on your rom

## READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING
Since this script executes commands trough root adb, there is some... nah, A LOT of risks involved. I take absolutely **NO** responsibility for bricking anyones phones. I decided to host this script on Github for personal use and possibly as a resource for those who are having difficulties installing the extension.

The commands this script runs were gathered from some [forum posts](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/privileged-extension-ota-workaround-for-los-17-1/11058), so take them with a grain of salt.

The script automatically downloads the latest Privileged Extension OTA zip file from the F-Droid website and also verifies the files. If the website is changed at all after the creation of this script, there is a risk of breakage.

### If you want to play it safe, stay away from this script and enjoy your working phone :)
